#Getting Started

#To get started with the ChatGPT API, you will need to sign up for an OpenAI API key. Once you have your key, you can install the requests module in Python by running the following command in your terminal:
pip install requests

#Next, you can import the requests module and define the endpoint URL and API key in your Python script:
import requests

ENDPOINT_URL = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/gpt3"
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

#Sending Messages
#To send a message to the ChatGPT API, you can define a function that takes in a message and returns the response. Here's an example function that you can use:
def send_message(message):
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
    }

    data = {
        "prompt": message,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "max_tokens": 50,
        "stop": ["\n", "User:"]
    }

    response = requests.post(ENDPOINT_URL, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()["choices"][0]["text"].strip()

#In this function, we are sending a POST request to the ChatGPT API with the message as the prompt. We are also setting the temperature parameter to 0.7, which controls the creativity of the response, and the max_tokens parameter to 50, which limits the maximum number of tokens in the response. Finally, we are setting the stop parameter to ["\n", "User:"] to indicate when the API should stop generating text.

#Once you have defined the send_message() function, you can use it to send messages to the ChatGPT API and get responses. Here's an example usage:
response = send_message("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)

#This will print out a response from the ChatGPT API based on the message you sent.
